if db_path == ":memory:" and workers_num > 1:
    # Auto-migrate to temp file to prevent segfaults
    temp_path = create_safe_temp_path()
    logger.info(f"AUTO-MIGRATED: :memory: + {workers_num} workers → {temp_path}")
```

db_path = create_temp_path("workflow")
queue = DuckQueue(db_path)          # Queue: job storage
dag = DAG("workflow", queue)        # DAG: workflow definition
worker = Worker(queue)              # Script: worker management
```

## Deployment Patterns

### Pattern 1: Single-Node Processing
```python
# For development, testing, or small workloads
queue = DuckQueue("app.db")
dag = DAG("simple", queue)
# Jobs execute locally with configurable concurrency
```

### Pattern 2: Multi-Worker Processing
```python
# For production workloads requiring parallelism
queue = DuckQueue("shared.db", workers_num=4)
# Automatic safety migration if needed
# Workers can be on same machine or distributed
```

### Pattern 3: Workflow Orchestration
```python
# For complex multi-stage processes
main_dag = DAG("orchestrator", queue)
main_dag.add_subdag(etl_pipeline, name="etl")
main_dag.add_subdag(ml_training, name="training", depends_on="etl")
main_dag.add_subdag(reporting, name="reports", depends_on=["etl", "training"])
```

### Pattern 4: Context-Driven Workflows
```python
# For workflows with data passing between tasks
def transform(context):
    raw_data = context.upstream("extract")
    return process(raw_data)

def load(context):
    processed_data = context.upstream("transform")
    return save_to_warehouse(processed_data)
```
