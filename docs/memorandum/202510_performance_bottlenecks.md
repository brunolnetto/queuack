Performance review â€” bottlenecks, risks and mitigations
=========================================================

This memo summarizes the hotspots and hard-coded values I found while reviewing
the codebase during the sub-DAG and submission performance work. For each item
I list: what I found, why it matters, short-term mitigations, estimated
implementation effort, and priority.

Structure
---------
- Summary of major hotspots
- Detailed items (with file hints)
- Suggested quick wins (low-risk)
- Suggested medium/long-term work (higher effort)
- Action plan and recommended next steps

Major summary
-------------
1. DAG submission: per-dependency insertion was a major bottleneck for large
   DAGs. Replaced with a single VALUES-based INSERT; for very large DAGs a
   temp-table approach is recommended.
   - Impact: high for large DAGs; medium for typical DAGs
   - Effort to fix completely (temp-table path + config): small-medium

2. Pickle overhead: repeated pickle.dumps during submission was costing CPU
   time; caching pickled blobs reduces work.
   - Impact: medium for DAG submissions with identical callables/args
   - Effort: small

3. Worker/claim visibility and shutdown races: tests were flaky due to timing
   races when workers were stopped; added short drains and explicit commit
   after bulk inserts.
   - Impact: test flakiness and user-visible shutdown ordering
   - Effort: small

4. VALUES-list SQL approach: while efficient for moderate sizes, it can blow up
   memory/SQL size and driver param limits for very large numbers of edges.
   Use temp table + chunked inserts for scale.
   - Impact: high for huge DAGs
   - Effort: small-medium (safe and incremental)

Detailed items, with file hints and why they matter
---------------------------------------------------
1) Poll intervals and sleep timings (files: `queuack/core.py`, `queuack/dag.py`, tests)
   - Locations: `poll_interval=1.0` default in Worker and DAG wait loops;
     tests use 0.1/0.05 overrides throughout.
   - Why it matters: mixed defaults and per-call literals are a source of
     flakiness in tightly timed tests and can overload CPU when many threads
     spin with tiny sleeps.
   - Mitigation: centralize configuration (DuckQueue options or a small
     `config` object) and avoid hard-coded overrides sprinkled across code.
   - Effort: small
   - Priority: medium (important for predictable behavior and CI stability)

2) Dependency insertion path (file: `queuack/dag.py`)
   - What: originally inserted dependencies one row at a time; improved to
     VALUES-based bulk insert. For very large DAGs this still constructs a
     huge SQL statement and long param list.
   - Why it matters: huge SQL string + params can exceed driver limits and
     cause memory + parse overhead.
   - Mitigation: implement temp-table approach (CREATE TEMP TABLE & chunked
     executemany into it, then one INSERT ... SELECT FROM tmp LEFT JOIN).
   - Effort: small-medium (implement behind a threshold to keep fast-path)
   - Priority: high for scalability

3) Commit timing & connection visibility (files: `queuack/dag.py`, `queuack/core.py`)
   - What: workers run on separate connections; after bulk insert we need to
     commit so other connections/threads see new rows.
   - Why it matters: without immediate commit, workers may not observe jobs
     promptly and tests/workflows see increased latency.
   - Mitigation: explicit commit after bulk inserts (already applied).
   - Effort: trivial
   - Priority: high (fix already applied)

4) Pickle cost and repeated datetime.now() calls (files: `queuack/dag.py`)
   - What: repeated pickle.dumps and datetime.now() per-row were extra costs.
   - Mitigation: cache pickled blobs during submission and use a single
     timestamp per submission (both applied).
   - Effort: small
   - Priority: medium

5) `:memory:` DB semantics and thread-local queue exposure (files: `queuack/core.py`, `queuack/dag.py`)
   - What: `:memory:` DuckDB does not share data across separate connections.
     There are special-case flows that use a shared connection or thread-local
     queue reference.
   - Why it matters: accidental creation of a new DuckQueue with `:memory:`
     breaks visibility; it's a footgun for tests and users.
   - Mitigation: document this behavior; prefer passing queue references or
     using the thread-local mechanism (already used by sentinel/inline paths).
   - Effort: documentation + small API guidance: small
   - Priority: medium

6) RLock and write serialization (file: `queuack/core.py`)
   - What: many operations take `self._db_lock` (RLock) serializing writes in
     the process. DuckDB handles locking at DB level too.
   - Why it matters: enqueue hot paths can contend on RLock under heavy load.
   - Mitigation: group operations (already done for batch enqueues) and
     consider specialized writer/worker patterns for high-throughput systems.
   - Effort: medium/architectural
   - Priority: low-medium (only matters under heavy load)

7) Index and query shapes (file: `queuack/core.py` schema)
   - What: current indexes appear reasonable for claim queries; monitor
     production patterns and add composite indexes if needed.
   - Effort: small
   - Priority: low (tune as needed)

Other small notes
-----------------
- Duplicate logging call in `Job.execute()` (minor cosmetic)
- Many magic defaults (priority=50, timeout_seconds=300, max_attempts=3)
  should be documented and optionally made globally configurable.

Quick wins (low-risk, small effort)
-----------------------------------
1. Implement temp-table chunked dependency insert behind a threshold
   (e.g., if len(dep_rows) > 2000). Effort: small. Priority: high.
2. Document `:memory:` semantics and recommend passing queue references.
   Effort: trivial. Priority: medium.
3. Move a handful of magic constants (drain seconds, dependency chunk size)
   to module-level constants or `DuckQueue` constructor args. Effort: small.

Medium-term work (moderate effort)
----------------------------------
1. Centralize runtime config (small config object or `DuckQueue.config`).
   This simplifies tuning for CI vs production. Effort: medium.
2. Add optional benchmarking harness (example script) to measure submission
   throughput vs DAG size. Effort: small-medium.
3. Revisit RLock usage for heavy-write scenarios; consider a single
   writer thread/queue or batching pattern. Effort: medium-high.

Implementation plan for temp-table path (concrete)
-------------------------------------------------
- When preparing dependencies (dep_rows):
  - If len(dep_rows) < VALUES_THRESHOLD (e.g., 2000): use current VALUES-based
    INSERT (fast-path).
  - Else (large):
    1. CREATE TEMP TABLE tmp_deps(child_job_id VARCHAR, parent_job_id VARCHAR)
    2. Insert dep_rows via executemany in chunks (e.g., 1000 rows per chunk)
    3. Run single INSERT INTO job_dependencies SELECT t.child_job_id, t.parent_job_id
       FROM tmp_deps t LEFT JOIN job_dependencies jd ON (...) WHERE jd.child_job_id IS NULL
    4. DROP TABLE tmp_deps (optional â€” temp table lifecycle may auto-drop)
- Make chunk size and threshold configurable via DuckQueue (constructor) or
  a module-level constant. Keep default conservative (threshold=2000, chunk=1000).

Estimated work & testing
------------------------
- Implement temp-table path: ~1-2 hours of dev + tests locally (small change,
  mostly DB statements) â€” low risk if implemented behind threshold.
- Run full test-suite: ~1 run (we already run ~57s with xdist) â€” confirm no
  regression.

### ðŸ”„ REMAINING: Performance Optimizations
The following optimizations are now lower priority since critical issues are resolved:

Suggested next action
---------------------
With critical concurrency and SubDAG issues resolved, the next priority is
implementing the temp-table fallback for very large DAG dependency inserts,
behind a safe threshold and with configurable chunk size. This is now a
**performance optimization** rather than a **critical fix**.

**Updated Priority Order:**
1. âœ… **DONE**: Concurrency safety (auto-migration)
2. âœ… **DONE**: SubDAG functionality
3. âœ… **DONE**: Connection safety
4. ðŸ”„ **NEXT**: Temp-table dependency insertion (performance)
5. ðŸ”„ **LATER**: Centralized configuration
6. ðŸ”„ **LATER**: RLock contention optimization

The system is now **production-ready and fully functional** - remaining items
are performance enhancements for scale.
