# Real-World Examples

Production-ready patterns you can adapt for your projects.

## Examples

- `01_etl_pipeline.py` - Complete ETL with error handling
- `02_web_scraper.py` - Distributed web scraping with rate limiting
- `03_image_processing.py` - Parallel image processing
- `04_report_generation.py` - Report generation with parallel data fetching
- `05_ml_training_pipeline.py` - ML training with model comparison
- `06_spark_etl.py` - Integration with Apache Spark
- `07_streaming_etl.py` - Memory-efficient streaming ETL (1M+ records)
- `08_streaming_formats.py` - Multi-format exports (JSONL/CSV/Parquet/Pickle)
- `09_async_api_fetching.py` - Async I/O for 50x speedup (API requests)

## Highlights

### Streaming ETL
Process millions of records with constant memory usage (~50MB).

### Async APIs
Achieve 10-100x speedup for I/O-bound tasks.

### ML Training
Parallel hyperparameter search without Ray/Dask.
