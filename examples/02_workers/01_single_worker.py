"""Long-running worker process.

This example demonstrates the basic worker pattern in Queuack:
- Enqueue multiple jobs to a queue
- Start a single worker process that continuously processes jobs
- The worker runs in a loop, claiming and executing jobs one by one
- Worker automatically exits when all jobs are processed (no timeout needed)

Key concepts:
- Worker: A process that continuously polls for and executes jobs
- Claim/Ack: Worker claims a job (marks it as being processed) then acks it when done
- Sequential processing: Single worker processes jobs one at a time
- Auto-exit: Worker stops when queue is empty for several seconds
