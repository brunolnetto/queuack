"""Handle shutdown signals properly.

This example demonstrates graceful shutdown handling in Queuack workers:
- Worker processes long-running jobs (5 seconds each)
- Signal handlers catch SIGTERM/SIGINT (Ctrl+C)
- Worker finishes current jobs before shutting down
- Tracks active jobs to prevent data loss during shutdown

Key concepts:
- Signal handling: Catch system signals for clean shutdown
- Graceful shutdown: Finish current work before stopping
- Active job tracking: Know which jobs are in progress
- No job loss: Ensure running jobs complete even during shutdown
