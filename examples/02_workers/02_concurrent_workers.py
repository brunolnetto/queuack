"""Multi-threaded worker for parallel execution.

This example demonstrates concurrent job processing in Queuack:
- Enqueue multiple slow-running jobs
- Start a worker with multiple threads (concurrency=4)
- Jobs are processed in parallel, significantly reducing total execution time
- Compare this to single-threaded processing which would take much longer
- Worker automatically exits when all jobs are processed

Key concepts:
- Concurrency: Multiple threads processing jobs simultaneously
- Parallel execution: Faster completion for CPU-bound or I/O-bound tasks
- Worker threads: Each thread claims and processes jobs independently
- Scalability: Handle more work by increasing concurrency
- Auto-exit: Worker stops when queue is empty for several seconds
