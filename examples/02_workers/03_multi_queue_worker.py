"""Worker listening to multiple queues with priorities.

This example demonstrates priority-based queue processing:
- Create multiple named queues with different priorities
- Enqueue jobs to specific queues
- Worker processes queues in priority order (highest first)
- Lower priority queues are processed only when higher ones are empty
- Worker automatically exits when all queues are empty

Key concepts:
- Named queues: Jobs can be routed to specific queues
- Queue priorities: Higher priority queues are processed first
- Worker queue list: Worker listens to multiple queues simultaneously
- Priority scheduling: Critical jobs get processed before background jobs
- Auto-exit: Worker stops when all queues are empty for several seconds
